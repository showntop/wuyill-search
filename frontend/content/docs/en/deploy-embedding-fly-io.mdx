## Why do you need to deploy your own embedding service?

You could refer to [Hybrid AI Search 1 -- how to build fast embedding service](/blog/fast-local-embedding-service)

The primary reason for deploying your own embedding service is performance. With a local embedding service, you can achieve results in **milliseconds**.

For multilingual text embedding, I tested and found that the results of the `paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2` model are better than the openai `text-embedding-3-large` model.

The last point is that your data privacy is more controllable.
